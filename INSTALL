The instructions below explain how to install ndiswrapper. This is
rather short version; more details about installation,
troubleshooting, FAQ etc. can be found in the Wiki at

http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/wiki

Prerequisites
=============

You need a recent kernel, at least 2.6.14, with header files for the
kernel. Make sure there is a link to the kernel source from the modules
directory. The command

  ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

should have at least 'include' directory and '.config' file.

Downloading
===========

Download the latest version of the ndiswrapper sources from here and
extract it with the command

  tar zxvf ndiswrapper-version.tar.gz

This will create ndiswrapper-version directory. Change to that
directory and run

  make uninstall
  make

Login as root and run
  make install

Install Windows driver
======================

If this is the first time you install ndiswrapper, you need to install
Windows driver for Windows XP (in some cases Windows NT or Windows
2000 may also work). First, get a Windows driver that is known to
work. See http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/wiki/List for status
about the device for which you are installing Windows driver. For
this, you need to identify device ID with

  lspci -nn

if it is PCI device or

  lsusb

if it is USB device.

Then lookup in that List for the device ID and if a driver is known to
work, get that driver. Occasionally, Windows driver on the CD or your
Windows partition may work, but if it doesn't, don't complain - get a
known-to-work driver.

Many Windows drivers are distributed either as zipped files or cab
files. Zipped files, even if they are .exe files, can be extracted
with 'unzip' in Linux; cab files can be extracted with combination of
'cabextract' and 'unshield' programs.

Once the driver has been unpacked, locate .inf and .sys files. If
necessary, move these files so both .inf and .sys are in the same
directory. Some drivers also come with firmware files, such as
fwrad16.bin etc. These files also should be in the same
directory. Then install the Windows driver with

  ndiswrapper -i driver.inf

This installs .inf file and required .sys and .bin files. Now, see if
installation of Windows driver is "valid" with

  ndiswrapper -l

This should report

"driver present, hardware present"

for the driver installed and if that driver is for the device that is
already in the system. If device is not present, it should report

"driver present"

If not, the Windows driver has not been installed properly.

Now load ndiswrapper module with

  modprobe ndiswrapper

If everything worked properly, this should initialize 'wlan0' wireless
device, which can be configured with wireless tools, such as
'iwconfig', 'wpa_supplicant' etc.
